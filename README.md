# PRG - Solved C Problems from Class

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to this little collection of C programs I wrote as part of my **PRG** class. This repo is not some kind of tutorial or guide—it's just a bunch of solutions to problems we tackled in class. If you were in the same course (or just want to see some C problem-solving in action), feel free to browse through and see how I approached things.

## 🤔 What’s This About?

This repository contains my **C language solutions** for various problems we were assigned in our PRG class. Some of them are simple, some a bit tricky, but all of them were meant to help us practice programming concepts like loops, arrays, pointers, and more.

If you're from the same course, maybe this can help you check your work or compare approaches. If not, well, you’re still welcome to take a look—but just know that this wasn’t built as a learning resource, just a place where I keep my completed assignments.

## 🚀 Running the Code

If you want to run any of the programs, here’s what to do:

1. **Clone the repo** (or just download the file you need):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Posiitron/PRG_solved_by_Posi.git
   cd PRG_solved_by_Posi
   ```

2. **Compile a program** using `gcc` (or whatever compiler you prefer). Example:

   ```bash
   gcc -o problem1 problem1.c
   ./problem1
   ```

3. **See what happens!** Hopefully, it works as expected. If not, well, debugging is part of the process.

## 🔍 Want to Test Your Own Solutions?

If you’re solving similar problems and want to **test your solutions** against various inputs automatically, I **highly recommend** using [mimi-brute](https://github.com/matiamic/mimi-brute). It’s a great tool for automating test cases and checking if your program gives the right output.

### How to Use `mimi-brute`

1. **Go to the repo:** [mimi-brute](https://github.com/matiamic/mimi-brute)
2. **Follow the instructions there** to install and set it up.
3. **Use it to compare outputs** and see if your program passes all test cases!

Super useful if you want to make sure your code actually works before turning in your assignment.

## ❗ Disclaimer

This is just **my** work from class. It’s not necessarily the best way to solve each problem, and there may be better, cleaner, or more efficient solutions out there. Don’t just copy-paste—try to understand what’s happening and use it as a reference.
